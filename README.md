# Peleke Sengstacke

**AI Engineer** · Atlanta, GA · [peleke.me](https://peleke.me)

I build AI systems that reason about language, identity, and meaning in ways humans actually trust.

RAG pipelines. Agent orchestration. Production inference. The infrastructure you're going to need—I've already built it.

### What I Ship

| Project | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **[LinWheel](https://linwheel.io)** | Multi-agent content pipeline | 90+ posts in 60 seconds. Six agents. Production-reliable orchestration. |
| **[Interlinear](https://interlinear.peleke.me)** | AI tutor with error classification | Distinguishes typos from conceptual gaps—evaluation harness patterns for education |
| **[LangLine](https://landline-landing.vercel.app)** | Mobile-first persistent AI sessions | Graph memory that compounds across sessions. Context that doesn't evaporate. |
| **[MindMirror](https://swae.peleke.me)** | Hybrid RAG + personal knowledge engine | Privacy-first personalization without shipping data to OpenAI |
