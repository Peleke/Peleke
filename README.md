### The Short Version

I've spent a decade teaching people to code and half of one writing about it. Now I build AI systems at the intersection of language, identity, and production reliability.

The thesis: Most AI tools make you sound like everyone else. I build the ones that don't.

### What I'm Shipping

**[LinWheel](https://linwheel.ai)** — *Be seen. Be heard. Be elsewhere.*

LinkedIn content tool built by a writer, not just an engineer. Multi-agent orchestration that turns what you're already consuming into posts that sound like *you*. Voice profiles. AI images. Direct publishing. The whole pipeline.

Currently pre-launch. [Demo Jan 14](https://linwheel.ai).
