# Peleke Sengstacke

I study how languages work and build tools from what I find.

### The Research Question

Can agents learn from their own performance?

Most systems marketed as "learning" are persisting context. Remembering, not adapting. I'm building the instrumentation to tell the difference: a five-layer architecture where learning can be observed and measured.
